# ðŸ¦€ CrabbyLB â€” A High-Performance HTTP Server & Load Balancer in C++

CrabbyLB is a custom, bare-metal HTTP server and load balancer implemented in **C++**. It uses raw socket programming (`netinet`) to handle HTTP requests and distributes them across multiple backend servers using a round-robin load balancing algorithm. 

With a focus on performance and concurrency, CrabbyLB is capable of handling high loads efficiently, making it a great starting point for learning about HTTP servers, load balancing, and low-level networking concepts.
